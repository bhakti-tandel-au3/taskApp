To run the app locally follow the below steps.
There are two modules of the app API and frontend. The frontend uses api to fetch data so first we have to run api.py file from the api folder. Then we have to run index.py file.

Run the below commands in terminal

1. cd taskApp-master
2. cd api
3. python3 api.py
4. open new terminal
5. cd taskApp-master
6. cd taskAPp
7. python3 index.py
